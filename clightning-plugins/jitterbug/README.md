Jitterbug
----
This plugin adds jitter to all HTLC forwards. By default no more than 5.555 seconds delay will ever be added, but this is configurable in the plugin source code. 

The delay added to each HTLC is not likely to withstand serious statistical analysis. Improvements and references to relevant literature would be greatly appreciated.
